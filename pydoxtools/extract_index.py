    For example, it is a good idea to make text-pieces not too small. Text pieces should
    also not bee too big. So that they encode not too much information
    into the vector. This makes queries on an index more precise.
    Additionally, we should try to segment a piece of text into its
    logical structure and try to preserve text blocks such as paragraphs,
    tables etc... as much as possible.

    if we split up large text blocks we will let the individual pieces overlap
    just a little bit in order to preserve some of the context.
