# Development & Contribution

The graph model of the library makes it very easy to extend it with new functionality.

- the document can be used as a base-model and overwritten with changes
- the graph can be changed dynamically
- new functions can be very easily integrated

## Pydoxtools Architecture

--> refer to "document"

## Visualizing Dependencies

The extraction logic graph can be visualized as follows:

pip install pydeps
sudo apt install graphviz
