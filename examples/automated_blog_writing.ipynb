    "# Pydoxtools: Automated, LLM based article writing with information retrieval from a directory of files in fewer than 100 lines of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "At Xyntopia, we are excited to introduce our latest creation, Pydoxtools - a versatile Python library designed to streamline AI-powered document processing and information retrieval. This library is perfect for users who are new to programming and want to harness the power of AI in their projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article showcases an efficient method to automate article writing for your project using ChatGPT and Pydoxtools in fewer than 100 lines of code. The script demonstrates the following key functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexing a directory containing files with PyDoxTools\n",
    "- Employing an agent for information retrieval within those files\n",
    "- Auto-generating a text based on a set objective\n",
    "\n",
    "You can execute this notebook or simply refer to our concise script, which executes these steps in less than 100 lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/Xyntopia/pydoxtools/blob/main/examples/automatic_project_writing.py\n",
    "\n",
    "or open this notebook in colab:  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/Xyntopia/pydoxtools/blob/main/examples/automated_blog_writing.ipynb\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/>\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Costs and API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ChatGPT is a paid service, and running the script once will cost you about 2-5 cents. Pydoxtools automatically caches all calls to ChatGPT. So subsequent runs usually turn out to be a little cheaper. To use ChatGPT, you will need to generate an OpenAI API key by registering an account at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](). Remember to keep your API key secure and do not share it with anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydoxtools already includes open source LLM-models which can do the same for free, locally on your computer. As of May 2023 this is being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safeguarding Your API Key in Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with sensitive information like API keys, it's crucial to ensure their security. In Google Colab, you can save your API key in a separate file, allowing you to share the notebook without exposing the key. To do this, follow these simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute the cell below to create a new file in your Colab environment. This file will store your API key, and it will be deleted automatically when the Colab runtime is terminated."
